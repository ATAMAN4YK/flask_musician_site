# *Hi there, I'm Denys and I'm Cyber Security student from Ukraine, Zhytomyr.* 👋

### 👉 WHY?

#### That project was created firstly for my portfolio also for university python discipline. Also, this project was created to improve backend python skills, this is my second Flask project. During the writing, the book "Flask Web Development Miguel Grinberg" was partially and selectively read. For my first Flask project, which is in my profile, I used university lecture material and YouTube videos.

#### I recommend the book for reading only for beginners, it is not very relevant at the moment.

### 👉 HOW LONG?

#### This project was written in about 2 weeks without rushing, about 2-3 hours a day, take into account that I am a beginner.

### 👉 THAT'S ALL?

#### In fact, this project can still be finished for a week, create a system for sending emails, add better protection with tokens, make the pages more beautiful, add more logic to the site, links to tracks, allow leaving comments, and so on. Improve the code.

#### I stopped with the thought that there is no point in doing this project for a long time, since first of all, I am already burnt out from it, and I also don't see the point in writing it any more, it is better to write a bigger and better project later than to constantly dust and redo this one. I believe that it is not necessary to stand in one place, that is, it is necessary to use some new technologies in the following projects.

### ⬇️ USED TECHNOLOGIES

#### ✅ Flask
#### ✅ Flask-Login
#### ✅ Flask-Migrate
#### ✅ Flask-SQLAlchemy
#### ✅ Flask-WTF
#### ✅ Jinja2
#### ✅ Blueprint
#### ✅ Bootstrap-Flask
#### ✅ 󠀢󠀢Werkzeug

### ⬇️ CREATED SYSTEMS

#### ❎ 󠀢󠀢Account system, with protection against repeating emails, protection of all form fields, etc. There are also protected pages to which only authorized users can access, after authorization it switches back to the previous action.

#### ❎ 󠀢󠀢System for adding albums. In addition, the album can be changed and deleted. When created, there is a check for repetition of the name and a lot of other checks. It is possible to add a photo. Moreover, only authorized people can add. Only the person who added can change and delete.

#### ❎ 󠀢󠀢At least some appearance was created on Bootstrap and Flex. This at least shows a little bit of my understanding of the front end side.

#### ❎ 󠀢󠀢Additionally, everything is stored in the database, in my case SQL Lite, but this does not matter much. The main thing is that data about users and albums are stored there.
